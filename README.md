## Problem Statement
1. Optimize dining hall functionalities for reduction of food wastage by implementing Machine Learning techniques to predict student turnout for each meal and improving Inventory Management to place orders to vendors, manage food items according to their expiry dates and other factors.
2. a. Need to upgrade current sick meal plan to a TakeAway plan through a convenient digital interface with secure login process for students to order food online, pick up their TakeAway meals, and provide continuous feedback thus both benefiting students and increasing sales. b. Increase food-wastage awareness through a social media platform.
3. During peak time, there is a shortage of cutlery in the student Dining Halls. Currently, there are three stands with racks for spoons, forks and knives, located at different parts in the dining hall. We need an IoT based solution to automatically detect shortage of cutlery and notify the waiter. This will be implemented by placing a weight sensor under each rack, which sends a signal to notify for a refill of specified cutlery at that particular location in the dining hall.
